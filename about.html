     <p> What is a paragraph?
Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
 a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, 
 though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. </p>
